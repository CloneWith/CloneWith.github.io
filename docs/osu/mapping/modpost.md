# My modding queue 摸图队列

This is my modding queue description on [osumod](https://osumod.com/Amrzs0971/). Put here for your convenience.

---

I'm just a newcomer in modding, currently practising a lot on it.
Using osumod or the forum thread is both welcome. If you use this site, you need to bump my thread then~

## Rule

- Make sure your map is almost finished. That is, to have *fixed diff spread* and basically timed and hitsounded.
- Your map *should be* in pending status.
- Describe your map simply in the `Comments` box, including the artist, title, language, genre, diffs to mod (empty for all diffs), and some other things if you would like to. **Don't leave this field empty!**
- If you need *only/extra* help in some ways (patterns, hitsounds, timing, etc.), you can mention it explicitly in comments. I'll help you to my fullest owo
- If you can accept M4M, then thanks! You can PM me after I accept your req!
- 本人说中文，如果想要中文摸，不用不好意思提出来~

## Preference

- Currently I accept diffs below Insane, Advanced and Hard diffs are favoured.
- I prefer Electric and Hardcore songs.
- Love Vocaloid and anime and video game songs. Any language or vocal voice is welcome. Feel free to send meme songs!
- Prefer short length maps (less than about 4 mins).

## Trivia

- I am busy from time to time, so be patient and wait for a while!
- Still lack of skills. So suggest you should consider find another modder to mod it twice.
- If you have doubt on my mod, just put it out! I'll be happy to explain that.
