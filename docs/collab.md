# 关于合作 Collaboration

Hi, glad to witness your interest in collaborating with me!

If you have any good idea on those projects below (or any new project), feel free to contact me on GitHub or by email!

Currently receiving/looking for cooperation on several projects. The detail as follows:

目前我在多个项目上接受合作/希望他人的合作。具体如下：

!!! warning "注意"
    Due to academic reasons, I would not have enough time for collaboration. Despite this, I will still read your request *at least every weekend*. So **be patient** and, I am always happy to receive your request!

    出于学业原因，没有充足时间用于合作项目。即便如此，我也会在*至少每周末*阅读您的需求。请**耐心等待**。

## 软件项目 Software {#software}

### [opsu!](https://github.com/clonewith/opsu)

opsu! is an *unofficial* open-source osu! client originally created by [@itdelatrisu](https://github.com/itdelatrisu). Now I'm adding some new features to it and will continuously maintain it for years.

### [かたわ少女: Re-Engineered](https://fhs.sh)

**Katawa Shoujo: Re-Engineered** is a fan-made modernization of the classic visual novel of *Four Leaf Studios* by **Fleeting Heartbeat Studios**, and I'm porting the original translation into *Simplified Chinese*.

是藉由 *Four Leaf Studios* 的原作重新编写的新版本，具有多方面的功能改进。我找到了原来的汉化版本，正在迁移原有翻译，希望有人协助校对。
